files:

benchMKresults (buffer of sorts)
fioTest 	  (dynamically created fio job file)
results-containing files (32 per different type of I/O and different Order of drives) (32 * 4 * 3 = 384 between hardware changes)

directories:
	hard-coded directory names
	format: i/o type (read, randwrite, randrw)+underscore+description of the order that drives are written to)
	
	
	things to test before letting the program run for the weekend or overnight:

software stuff:
	-the orders of drive use
	-the i/o type used in fio
	-the block  size
	-filesize ETA
	-CPU usage?
	
	
Can Hardware break the test?
